\section{In regards to TriLab Job classification effort}

Monitoring data is high dimensional data. Na\"{i}vely, it's dimensions are in types of metric counters plus time steps. Even for modern ML models, the dimensionality pushes its limits. In this project we appealed to RNNs and LSTMs.

The act of labeling a monitoring dataset is wrought IT tribal turmoil and human labor intensive to boot. This effort focused on clustering and other unsupervised methods.

Since the intrinsic information in the monitoring set is unknown, it is unclear exactly what a "good sampling" would be. With Blue Waters data, our initial semi-successful clustering ocured when training on roughly 2k jobs.
